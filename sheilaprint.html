<p>I made that post while having a good time in a top club in South Africa.
I saw the kind of experience they offer, and I wished to bring the same to my party.
 My post was about bringing that international allure to my event—international
 dancers and bottle girls on every table.</p>

Whoever is near me knows that I want everyone near me to get money and enjoy life equally.
