<p><b>Rema, the Afrobeats star who does not intend to calm down</b></p>
In a landmark moment for African music, Nigerian Afrobeats sensation Rema has
 been named the only African artist on TIME Magazine’s prestigious 2025 TIME100
  Next list, a distinction that underscores his meteoric rise
 and the growing influence of African sound on the global stage.
 <p>Nigerian Afrobeats star Rema is conquering the world. His latest milestone came this week when he wowed football legends at the Ballon D'Or awards just days after
     making history with Calm Down, the longest-charting and most successful African song of all time on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.
    The 23-year-old appears to be riding the crest of an unstoppable wave of success. His is the latest in a string of African achievements including;</p>
    
    Burna Boy's 2021 Grammy award winner,
    Ckay's Love Nwantiti becoming the most Shazamed song in the world in 2021,
    Jerusalema by Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode, inspiring millions of people around the world to post videos
     of themselves dancing during the Covid pandemic.
    <p>Rema, unlike some of his fellow Afrobeats artists, is always mindful of his place in the journey 
    of African music, and his
     debt to those who have laid the groundwork and made it possible for this 
    young man to have reached global stardom so fast.
    For example, he is due to play London's O2 Arena on 14 November - a venue with a 20,000
     capacity - just four years into his career. It took the likes of his compatriots Wizkid and 
     Burna Boy a decade to achieve this.</p>
