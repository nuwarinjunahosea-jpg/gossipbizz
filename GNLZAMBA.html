<p><b>GNL Zamba shuts out Ugandan music industry from his home.</b></p>
Baboon Forest CEO GNL Zamba has stated that he will never allow anyone from Uganda’s music industry to set foot in his home.
Now based in Muyenga with his wife, an American national, GNL says he has drawn a boundary between
 his public and private life.
<p>If you are from the Ugandan music industry, you will never step into my house. I don’t want any of them around, 
I got faded up of them and their bad energy.
The rapper, who has long been vocal about protecting his peace and mental well-being, insists this
 decision has nothing to do with pride or arrogance.</p>
<p>Even my close friends in the industry haven’t been to my house. When you reach my age, the most 
important thing is peace and going back to your
 family in a nice setting, that’s everything to me.
GNL added that while he doesn’t believe anyone he knows would directly harm his family,

 he is cautious about the kind of energy he allows into his space.</p>
