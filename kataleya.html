<p><b>KATALEYA AND KANDLE LATEST NEWS</b></p>
Uganda’s dynamic female duo, Kataleya and Kandle, have unveiled the highly 
anticipated music video for their latest single, “Salongo,” further cementing their status
 as trailblazers in the East African music scene.
 Music duo Kataleya and Kandle have discussed the lives they might lead after they go their separate ways.

The duo, during an interview with Galaxy FM, revealed they would each go a different path at one point in life, but when that time comes, 
they would wish to still be together as friends and sisters.
Unlike other groups that break up bitterly, Kataleya and Kandle noted that their bond started way back
 before they did
 music and won’t just go down the drain over a simple quarrel.
<p>“We wish to stay together until we feel like it’s time to retire. We will obviously not die doing music but when the time comes.
 It is not that music brought us together 
 we have been friends before the music thing.
When we decide that the business is over and each of us wants to take
 another path, we will still have a bond. We have a strong friendship that is strong that even with
  this, we will still visit each other; her children will come to my place and vice versa.
I know this will happen,” Kataleya said.</p>
